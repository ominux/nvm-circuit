                 prone. It is easy to make a mistake in synchronization
                 that produces a data race, yet it can be extremely hard
                 to locate this mistake during debugging. This article
                 describes a new tool, called Eraser, for dynamically
                 detecting data races in lock-based multithreaded
                 programs. Eraser uses binary rewriting techniques to
                 monitor every shared-monory reference and verify that
                 consistent locking behavior is observed. We present
                 several case studies, including undergraduate
                 coursework and a multithreaded Web search engine, that

  abstract =     "One way to provide fault isolation among cooperating
                 software modules is to place each in its own address
                 space. However, for tightly-coupled modules, this
                 solution incurs prohibitive context switch overhead. In
                 this paper, we present a software approach to
                 implementing fault isolation within a single address
                 space. Our approach has two parts. First, we load the
                 code and data for a distrusted module into its own
                 fault domain, a logically separate portion of the
                 application's address space. Second, we modify the
                 object code of a distrusted module to prevent it from
                 writing or jumping to an address outside its fault
                 domain. Both these software operations are portable and
                 programming language independent. \par Our approach
                 poses a tradeoff relative to hardware fault isolation:
                 substantially faster communication between fault
                 domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution time
                 for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for
                 frequently communicating modules, implementing fault
                 isolation in software rather than hardware can
                 substantially improve end-to-end application
                 performance.",

                 the kernel of an operating system for C. mmp, the
                 Carnegie-Mellon Multi-Mini-Processor. This philosophy
                 is realized through the introduction of a generalized
                 notion of ``resource,'' both physical and virtual,
                 called an ``object.'' Mechanisms are presented for
                 dealing with objects, including the creation of new
                 types, specification of new operations applicable to a
                 given type, sharing, and protection of any reference to
                 a given object against improper application of any of
                 the operations defined with respect to that type of
                 object. The mechanisms provide a coherent basis for
                 extension of the system in two directions: the
                 introduction of new facilities, and the creation of
                 highly secure systems.",

automatically assist in constructing real-time systems. In this
approach, source programs are written in TCEL (or Time Constrained
Event Language) which possesses high-level timing constructs, and
whose semantics characterizes time-constrained relationships between
observable events. A TCEL program infers only those timing constraints
necessary to achieve real-time correctness, without over-constraining
the system. We exploit this looser semantics to help transform
programs to automatically achieve schedulability. In this article we
present two such transformations. The first is trace-scheduling, which
we use to achieve consistency between a program's worst-case execution
time and its real-time requirements. The second is program-slicing,
which we use to automatically tune application programs driven by
rate-monotonic scheduling."

an optimizing compiler can exploit this looser semantics to help tune
the code, so that its worst-case execution time is consistent with its
real-time requirements. In this paper we describe such a
transformation system, which works in two phases. First the TCEL
source code is translated into an intermediate representation. Then an
instruction-scheduling algorithm rearranges selected unobservable
operations, and synthesizes tasks guaranteed to respect the original
event-based constraints."

Systems, which took place on June 21, 1994, in in Orlando,
Florida. The workshop was held in concert with ACM SIGPLAN Conference
on Programming Languages Design and Implementation. The first talk
({"}Statements about Real-Time: Truth or Bull?{"}) was given in the
early morning. At the behest of the workshop's organizers, its primary
function was to seed the ongoing discourse and provoke some
debate. Besides asking controversial questions, and positing opinions,
the talk also identified some several fertile research areas that
might interest PLDI attendees.  The second talk ({"}Languages and
Transformations: Some Solutions{"}) was more technical, and it
reviewed our research on program optimizations for real-time
domains. However, I tried as much as possible to revisit the research
problems raised in the morning talk, and present some possible
approaches to them. The following paragraphs contain the text from my
viewgraphs, laced with some commentary.  Since so much work has been
done in real-time systems - and even more in programming languages -
my references are by necessity incomplete."

first-class timing constructs, whose semantics is based on
time-constrained relationships between observable events. Since a
system specification postulates timing relationships between events,
realizing the specification in a program becomes a more
straightforward process. Using these constraints, as well as those
imposed by data and control flow properties, the objective is to
transform the code so that its worst-case execution time is consistent
with its real-time requirements. To accomplish this goal the authors
first translate an event-based source program into intermediate code,
in which the timing constraints are imposed on the code itself, and
then use a compilation technique which synthesizes feasible code from
the original source program."

	abstract = "Partial evaluation is an important technique that
provides significant advantages for hard real-time (HRT)
programming. It allows specialization of reusable HRT programs with
high level language features and thereby tailors them for a particular
environment. These specialized programs are amenable to estimation of
execution time. With the tight estimation of execution time for the
residual programs, it will be feasible to use high level features for
real-time programming and thereby increasing programmer
productivity. This technique can change the way real-time programs are
written as the programmers are not restricted from using recursion,
dynamic memory, and pointers. We have given the formal semantics of a
language and a partial evaluator and shown that the partial evaluator
maintains the semantics of the programs. We have described a method
for handling access to nonlocal variables in the presence of recursion
that does not convert compile-time variables into run-time
variables. This is a significant result for partial evaluation of
imperative languages. The static distinction between run-time and
compile-time variables helps in simplifying partial evaluation,
controlling code explosion, properly handling nonlocal compile-time
variables, and providing concise and useful error messages."

	abstract = "We present a polynomial time algorithm for
constructing a minimum completion time schedule of instructions from a
basic block on RISC machines such as the Sun SPARC, the IBM 801, the
Berkeley RISC machine, and the HP Precision Architecture. Our
algorithm can be used as a heuristic for RISC processors with longer
pipelines, for which there is no known optimal algorithm. Our
algorithm can also handle time-critical instructions, which are
instructions that have to be completed by a specific time.
Time-critical instructions occur in some real-time computations, and
can also be used to make shared resources such as registers quickly
available for reuse. We also prove that in the absence of
time-critical constraints, a greedy scheduling algorithm always
produces a schedule for a target machine with multiple identical
pipelines that has a length less than twice that of an optimal
schedule. The behavior of the heuristic is of interest because, as we
show, the instruction scheduling problem becomes NP-hard for arbitrary
length pipelines, even when the basic block of code being input
consists of only several independent streams of straightline code, and
there are no time-critical constraints. Finally, we prove that the
problem becomes NP-hard even for small pipelines, no time-critical
constraints, and input of several independent streams of straightline
code if either there is only a single register or if no two
instructions are allowed to complete simultaneously because of some
shared resource such as a bus."

                 deployment, security issues become a central concern.
                 So far, much research has focused on making sensor
                 networks feasible and useful, and has not concentrated
                 on security. We present a suite of security building
                 blocks optimized for resource-constrained environments
                 and wireless communication. SPINS has two secure
                 building blocks: SNEP and $\mu$-TESLA. SNEP provides
                 the following important baseline security primitives:
                 Data confi-dentiality, two-party data authentication,
                 and data freshness. A particularly hard problem is to
                 provide efficient broadcast authen-tication, which is
                 an important mechanism for sensor networks. $\mu$-TESLA
                 is a new protocol which provides authenticated
                 broadcast for severely resource-constrained
                 environments. We implemented the above protocols, and
                 show that they are practical even on mini-mal hardware:
                 the performance of the protocol suite easily matches
                 the data rate of our network. Additionally, we
                 demonstrate that the suite can be used for building
                 higher level protocols.",

                 can guarantee hard deadlines for both periodic and

                 of a chain of subtasks which execute on different
                 processors. In order to guarantee that all timing
                 constraints are met in such a system, it is imperative
                 to be able to determine the end-to-end response time
                 for each task. This report focuses on distributed
                 systems where tasks are periodic and scheduled
                 according to fixed priority scheduling algorithms.
                 Moreover, if a subtask has predecessors, every instance
                 of the subtask is released as soon as the corresponding
                 instance of the immediate predecessor subtask
                 completes. This report describes an algorithm that can

                 important, but in existing systems, maintaining the
                 consistency of replicated data is quite expensive. The
                 Totem single-ring protocol supports consistent
                 concurrent operations by placing a total order on
                 broadcast messages. This total order is derived from
                 the sequence number in a token that circulates around a
                 logical ring imposed on a set of processors in a
                 broadcast domain. The protocol handles reconfiguration
                 of the system when processors fail and restart or when
                 the network partitions and remerges. Extended virtual
                 synchrony ensures that processors deliver messages and
                 configuration changes to the application in a
                 consistent, systemwide total order. An effective flow
                 control mechanism enables the Totem single-ring
                 protocol to achieve message-ordering rates
                 significantly higher than the best prior total-ordering

  abstract =     "{\em Threads\/} are the vehicle for concurrency in
                 many approaches to parallel programming. Threads can be
                 supported either by the operating system kernel or by
                 user-level library code in the application address
                 space, but neither approach has been fully
                 satisfactory. This paper addresses this dilemma. First,
                 we argue that the performance of kernel threads is {\em
                 inherently\/} worse than that of user-level threads,
                 rather than this being an artifact of existing
                 implementations; managing parallelism at the user level
                 is essential to high-performance parallel computing.
                 Next, we argue that the problems encountered in
                 integrating user-level threads with other system
                 services is a consequence of the lack of kernel support
                 for user-level threads provided by contemporary
                 multiprocessor operating systems; kernel threads are
                 the {\em wrong abstraction\/} on which to support
                 user-level management of parallelism. Finally, we
                 describe the design, implementation, and performance of
                 a new kernel interface and user-level thread package
                 that together provide the same functionality as kernel
                 threads without compromising the performance and
                 flexibility advantages of user-level management of
                 parallelism.",

                 performance of SPIN, an extensible operating system.
                 SPIN provides an extension infrastructure together with
                 a core set of extensible services that allow
                 applications to safely change the operating system's
                 interface and implementation. These changes can be
                 specified with fine-granularity, allowing applications
                 to achieve a desired level of performance and
                 functionality from the system. Extensions are
                 dynamically linked into the operating system kernel at
                 application runtime, enabling them to access system
                 services with low overhead. A capability-based
                 protection model that relies on language and link-time
                 mechanisms enables the system to inexpensively export
                 fine-grained interfaces to system services. SPIN and
                 its extensions are written in Modula-3 and run on DEC
                 Alpha workstations.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents a framework for a membership
                 service that operates in a partitionable environment
                 and supports partitionable operation, which is a form
                 of distributed operation in which multiple network
                 components that are (temporarily) disconnected from
                 each other operate autonomously. The service assumes an
                 asynchronous environment and must tolerate crash
                 failures, omission failures and network partitions. The
                 principles of partitionable operation that we present
                 here have been incorporated in the Transis system [13,
                 1], the Totem system [3], and the Horus system [19].
                 The paper discusses applications built in these
                 projects, and relates them to the membership service
                 definition. We introduce a distinction between partial
                 and complete installations of system views that makes
                 feasible what we believe are the strongest possible
                 requirements for causal order and virtual synchrony. We
                 propose our specification of partitionable membership
                 service as a standard against which other memb...",

                 potential performance advantages of the EC model but
                 requires a programming interface as simple as that of
                 RC or LRC. It does this by exploiting the implicit
                 dynamic binding between data and synchronization events
                 variables. In our simulation studies, we compared ScC
                 with Automatic Update Release Consistency (AURC), a
                 modified LRC model that takes advantage of new network
                 interfaces. For two of the four real applications we
                 used, ScC reduced the running time by about 11\%."

                 capturing the semantics of virtual synchrony as
                 implemented in Horus, is presented. This definition has
                 the nice property that every message is delivered
                 within the view in which it was sent. However, it is
                 shown that in order to implement strong virtual
                 synchrony, the application program has to block
                 messages during view changes. An alternative
                 definition, called {\em weak virtual synchrony}, which
                 can be implemented without blocking messages, is then
                 presented. This definition still guarantees that
                 messages will be delivered within the view in which
                 they were sent, only that it uses a slightly weaker
                 notion of what the view in which a message was sent is.
                 An implementation of weak virtual synchrony that does
                 not block messages during view changes is developed,
                 and it is shown how to use a system that provides weak
                 virtual synchrony even when strong virtual synchrony is
                 actually needed. To capture additional ordering
                 requirements, the definition of {\em ordered virtual
                 synchrony} is presented. Finally, it is discussed how
                 to extend the definitions in order to cope with the
                 fact that a process can become a member of more than
                 one group.",

  abstract =     "Code scalability, crucial on any parallel system,
                 determines how well parallel code avoids becoming a
                 bottleneck as its host computer is made larger. The
                 scalability of computer code can be estimated by
                 statistically designed experiments that empirically
                 approximate a multivariate Taylor expansion of the
                 code's execution response function. Each suspected code
                 bottleneck corresponds to a first-order term in the
                 expansion, the coefficient for that term indicating how
                 sensitive execution is to changes in the suspect
                 location. However, it is the expansion coefficients for
                 second-order interactions between code segments and the
                 number of processors that are fundamental to
                 discovering which program elements impede parallel
                 speedup. A new, unified view of these second-order
                 coefficients yields an informal relative scalability
                 test of high utility in code development. Discussion
                 proceeds through actual examples, including a
                 straightforward illustration of the test applied to
                 SLALCOM, a complex, multiphase benchmark. A quick
                 graphical shortcut makes the scalability test readily

                 Traditional techniques for short-term scheduling result
                 in serious limitations on interprocessor communication;
                 a two-phase blocking scheme is suggested as a solution
                 to the problem. Long-term scheduling policies that
                 assume process independence result in a form of
                 thrashing when there are groups of cooperating
                 processes. The notion of coscheduling is introduced,
                 and three algorithms are described for achieving it.
                 Simulation results suggest that substantial degrees of
                 coscheduling can be achieved over a variety of

                 cannot be solved in an asynchronous system if even a
                 single crash failure can occur. In this paper, we show
                 that there are other problems that cannot be solved in
                 an asynchronous system, and for the same intuitive
                 reason: it is impossible to distinguish a very slow
                 processor from a crashed processor. However, these
                 problems are harder than Consensus, in that there are
                 contexts in which Consensus can be solved but these
                 other problems cannot. More precisely, the weakest
                 failure detector that is needed to solve these problems
                 is a Perfect Failure Detector, which is strictly
                 stronger than the weakest failure detector that is
                 needed to solve Consensus. We use a formulation of the
                 Election problem as the prototype for these problems
                 that are harder than Consensus.",
  annote =       "Contains a good and concise definition of failure
                 detectors \`a la Chandra and Toueg
                 \cite{Chandra:1996:UFD} in terms of temporal logic. The
                 proof idea is as follows: a failure detector has very
                 weak completeness iff eventually every process that
                 crashes is suspected at least once by some correct
                 process. The authors then show that (1) strong accuracy
                 and very weak completeness are necessary to solve
                 election, and (2) that both together are sufficient.
                 This shows that a strongly complete and very weakly
                 accurate failure detector is the weakest failure
                 detector necessary for election. Very weak completeness
                 and strong accuracy however suffice to implement a
                 perfect failure detector. Thus the weakest failure
                 detector for election is stronger than the weakest
                 failure detector for consensus. Thus, election is
                 harder than consensus. Other problems as hard as
                 election are primary backup and (probably) terminating
                 reliable broadcast.",

  abstract =     "To design effective large-scale multiprocessors,
                 computer architects need to understand how parallel
                 applications will be scaled to use these machines. The
                 methods used to study scaling so far have been based on
                 the computation and communication complexities of
                 individual algorithms, with the data set size typically
                 being the only application parameter that is scaled.
                 The scaling of real applications, however, is
                 considerably more complicated. Other parameters often
                 need to be scaled along with the data set size to
                 reflect how an application scientist would really use
                 additional computing power. We show that system
                 designers must understand these application
                 considerations and use appropriate scaling methods for
                 their benchmark applications, to reach the correct
                 conclusions about the effectiveness and design of
                 larger machines. To demonstrate this, we propose a
                 realistic scaling methodology, apply it to some
                 important scientific applications, and compare the
                 resulting architectural implications with those that
                 would be obtained by scaling only the data set size.",

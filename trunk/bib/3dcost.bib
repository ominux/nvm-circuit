   BookTitle = {ICCD},
   Abstract = {The deployment of future deep submicron technology calls for a careful review of existing cache organizations and design practices in terms of yield and performance. This paper presents a cache design flow that enables processor architects to consider yield, area, and performance (YAP) together in a unified framework. Since there is a complex, changing trade-off between these metrics depending on the technology, the cache organization, and the yield enhancement scheme employed, such a design flow becomes invaluable to processor architects when they assess a design and explore the design space quickly at an early stage. We develop a complete set of tools supporting the proposed design flow, from injecting defects into a wafer to evaluating program performance of individual processors in the wafer. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design flow and developed tools.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we present an analytical modelfor the calculation ofcost andyield of incrementally assembled 3D-stacked multi-chip modules. We adopt generic cost andyield estimation models, investigate alternative building techniques and assess the sensitivity ofthe various modelparameters, including yieldper building step, availability ofknown good dies and testing per building step. We apply the modelfor the estimation of cost ofa complex 3D System in Package based on the RMPD 3D-CSP?) technology.},

   Title = {{2.5-Dimensional VLSI System Integration}},
   Journal = {IEEE Transcation on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems},
   Abstract = {The excessive interconnection delay and fast increasing development cost, as well as complexity of the single-chip integration of different technologies, are likely to become the major stumbling blocks for the success of monolithic system-on-chips. To address the above problems, this paper investigates a new VLSI integration paradigm, the so-called 2.5-dimensional (2.5-D) integration scheme. Using this scheme, a VLSI system is implemented as a three-dimensional stacking of monolithic chips. A cost analysis framework was developed to justify the 2.5-D integration scheme from an economic point of view. Enabling technologies for the new integration scheme are also reviewed.},

   Abstract = {It has been shown that stacking a set of known good dice into a 3D chip array may be beneficial in terms of system performance and footprint area. This paper demonstrates that, in the general sense, it is also beneficial to arrange chips into a 3D stack from yield and cost perspectives. It is shown that an optimal point occurs where cost is minimized by stacking an appropriate amount of dice into a single system.},

   Title = {{Extending Systems-on-Chip to the Third Dimension: Performance, Cost and Technological Tradeoffs}},
   BookTitle = {ICCAD},
   Abstract = {Because of the today's market demand for highperformance, high-density portable hand-held applications, electronic system design technology has shifted the focus from 2-D planar SoC single-chip solutions to different alternative options as tiled silicon and single-level embedded modules as well as 3-D integration. Among the various choices, finding an optimal solution for system implementation dealt usually with cost, performance and other technological trade-off analysis at the system conceptual level. It has been identified that the decisions made within the first 20% of the total design cycle time will ultimately result upto 80% of the final product cost. In this paper, we discuss appropriate and realistic metric for performance and cost trade-off analysis both at system conceptual level (up-front in the design phase) and at implementation
phase for verification in the three-dimensional integration. In order to validate the methodology, two ubiquitous electronic
systems are analyzed under various implementation schemes and discuss the pros and cons of each of them.},

   Title = {Mapping System-on-Chip Designs from 2-D to 3-D ICs},
   BookTitle = {ISCAS},
   Abstract = {System-on-chip (SoC) designs suffer from the growing global interconnect delay as device density and chip area increase. Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3-D ICs) have been proposed as a way to reduce global wire length. Despite this key advantage of 3-D ICs, 3-D designs must effectively address two critical issues: heat dissipation and manufacturing cost. In this paper, we propose a new methodology that explores the trade-off between performance and cost of a SoC design, while keeping maximum on-chip temperature at an acceptable level. We analyze the performance of two multimedia systems and describe the implications of scaling SoC designs to 3-D.},

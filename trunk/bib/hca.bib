   Abstract = {Three-dimension technologies offer great promise in providing improvements in the overall circuit performance. Physical design plays a major role in the ability to exploit the flexibilities offered in the third dimension, and this article gives an overview of placement and routing methods for FPGA- and ASIC-style designs. We describe CAD techniques for placement and routing in 3D ICs, developed under our 3D analysis and design optimization framework. These approaches address a dichotomy of design styles, both FPGA and ASIC. The factors that are important in each style are different, so that a one-size-fits-all approach is impractical, and therefore, we present separate approaches for 3D physical design for each of these technologies. Hence, our FPGA placement method uses a two-step optimization process that minimizes inter-tier vias first, followed by further optimization within and across tiers. In contrast, the ASIC flow uses cost function weighting to discourage, but not minimize, inter-tier crossings.},

FPGA integration is presented. The circuit is first divided into

critical paths. We use our tool, which will be available on the web
for the research community, as a platform for exploring potential
benefits in terms of delay and wire-length that 3D technologies have
to offer for FPGA fabrics. We show that 3D integration results in
wire-length reduction for FPGA designs. However, unlike the ASIC
case, wire-length reduction does not automatically translate to much
smaller circuit delays, unless multi-segment lengths are employed
between layers. Our empirical analysis shows that wire-length can
be reduced by up to 50% (20% on average) using 5 layers. Delay
reductions are estimated to be up to 30% (15% on average) using
the same number of layers.},

Our results show that, due to both diminishing improvements in clock rates and poor wire scaling as semiconductor devices shrink, the achievable performance growth of conventional microarchitectures will slow substantially. In this paper, we describe technology-driven models for wire capacitance wire delay, and microarchitectural component delay. Using the results of these models, we measure the simulated performance-estimating both clock rate and IPC-of an aggressive out-of-order microarchitecture as it is scaled from a 250 nm technology to a 35 nm technology. We perform this analysis for three clock scaling targets and two microarchitecture scaling strategies: pipeline scaling and capacity scaling. We find that no scaling strategy permits annual performance improvements of better than 12.5% which is far worse than the annual 50-60% to which we have grown accustomed.},

We describe a new hierarchical approach for predicting the reliability of Cu-based interconnects in circuit layouts, and present an RCAD tool, SysRel, for such an analysis. We propose a (jL) product filtering algorithm with a classification of separate via-above and via-below treatments in Cu interconnect trees. After the filtering of immortal trees, a default model is applied to the remaining trees to compute reliability figures for individual units. SysRel utilizes joint stochastic reliability metrics based on the desired lifetime of a chip and combines reliability figures from individual fundamental reliability units. Simulation results with a 32-bit comparator circuit layout demonstrate the significance of our methodology in selectively identifying critical nets and their impacts on overall reliability.},

   Abstract = {Performance of deep-submicrometer very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is being increasingly dominated by the interconnects due to decreasingwire pitch and increasing die size. Additionally, heterogeneous integration of different technologies in one single chip is becoming increasingly desirable, for which planar (two-dimensional) ICs may not be suitable. This paper analyzes the limitations of the existing interconnect technologies and design methodologies and presents a novel three-dimensional (3-D) chip design strategy that exploits the vertical dimension to alleviate the interconnect related problems and to facilitate heterogeneous integration of technologies to realize a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design. A comprehensive analytical treatment of these 3-D ICs has been presented and it has been shown that by simply dividing a planar chip into separate blocks, each occurring a separate physical level interconnected by short and vertical interlayer interconnects (VILICs), significant improvement in performance and reduction in wire-limited chip area can be achieved, without the aid of any other circuit or design innovations. A scheme to optimize the interconnect distribution among different interconnect tiers is presented and the effect of transferring the repeaters to upper Si layers has been quantified in this analysis for a two-layer 3-D chip. Furthermore, one of the major concerns in 3-D ICs arising due to power dissipation problems has been analyzed and an analytical model has been presented to estimate the temperatures of the different active layers. It is demonstrated that advancement in heat sinking technology will be necessary in order to extract maximum performance from these chips. Implications of 3-D device architecture on several design issues have also been discussed with special attention to SoC design strategies. Finally some of the promising technologies for manufacturing 3-D ICs have been outlined},

With sufficiently dense die-to-die interconnect devices as complex as an iA32 microprocessor can be repartitioned or split between two die in order to simultaneously improve performance and power. The 3D structure of this emerging technology is examined and applied in this paper to a real x86 deeply pipelined high performance microprocessor. In this initial study, it is shown that a 3D implementation can potentially improve the performance by 15% while improving power by 15%.},

   Abstract = {Power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. In addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. Wattch is 1000X or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. It also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar SimpleScalar framework.},

   Abstract = {Stacked 3D silicon has been under development for a number of years at a substantial level of investment on the part of Government as well as public and private investors. Volume manufacturing of this technology is now in place and foundry services are provided to designers of Stacked 3D silicon components and products. Stacked 3D silicon has already had a major impact on microelectronics systems and products into which it has been integrated. Examples given include solid state data recorders, digital signal processors, massively parallel processors, artificial neural netwoks, imaging processing, and imaging sensors. Manufacturing and cost issues are identified and discussed along with present status and projections showing that, as volumes rise, no significant premium will be required to incorporate Stacked 3D Silicon into standard products. The performance advantages of Stacked 3D silicon are very large: the ultra-high scale density results in factors of hundreds to thousands in both speed and power when ICs are designed for 3D. The paper concludes with a picture of the coming next generation 3D stacked silicon: 10-1000 layers of ultra-thin, low power circuits with 1000s of inter-layer interconnect comprising entire systems in a single cube},

Temperature-tracking is thus becoming of paramount importance in modern electronic design automation (EDA) tools. In this paper we present two thermal placement tools for standard cell and macro cell design styles respectively. They are aimed at reducing hot spots in a design without compromising traditional design metrics such as area and wire length. We developed a compact substrate thermal model that can be used by the placer to calculate the temperature profile of a placement efficiently, or to convert the user-specified temperature constraint into the corresponding power distribution constraint as an alternative placement objective. As a result, our method is much more efficient than directly employing temperature profile simulation during the placement process. The simulation results show noticeable improvement of thermal distribution over the traditional placement algorithm, with little impact on area and wire length of the final layut},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we address the design of a future high-speed router that supports line rates as high as OC-3072 (160 Gb/s), around one hundred ports and several service classes. Building such a high-speed router would raise many technological problems, one of them being the packet buffer design, mainly because in router design it is important to provide worst-case bandwidth guarantees and not just average-case optimizations. A previous packet buffer design provides worst-case bandwidth guarantees by using a hybrid SRAM/DRAM approach. Next-generation routers need to support hundreds of interfaces (i.e., ports and service classes). Unfortunately, high bandwidth for hundreds of interfaces requires the previous design to use large SRAMs which become a bandwidth bottleneck. The key observation we make is that the SRAM size is proportional to the DRAM access time but we can reduce the effective DRAM access time by overlapping multiple accesses to different banks, allowing us to reduce the SRAM size. The key challenge is that to keep the worst-case bandwidth guarantees, we need to guarantee that there are no bank conflicts while the accesses are in flight. We guarantee bank conflicts by reordering the DRAM requests using a modern issue-queue-like mechanism. Because our design may lead to fragmentation of memory across packet buffer queues, we propose to share the DRAM space among multiple queues by renaming the queue slots. To the best of our knowledge, the design proposed in this paper is the fastest buffer design using commodity DRAM to be published to date.},

   Pages = {254-258},
   Abstract = {There are two competing technologies pursuing the 'holy grail' of complete system integration. Today, the most common method used to create the 'system' is to mount separately packaged ICs on a next-level substrate. Even with a low pin count, a package is typically several times larger than the IC, to accommodate the low wiring density on the PCB. High-performance systems, such as network processor systems, require high data bandwidth between key components and thus need an increased number of signal I/Os. Wide I/O busses switching at high speeds consequently require a larger nuber of power and ground pins to reduce switching noise. As a result, system performance is limited by increasing package size and the associated parasitic inductance and capacitance of the package and its connection on the PCB. System on chip (SoC) architecture attempts to integrate many functions, both analog and digital into a monolithic device. The successes are many, but so are the challenges. Many functions cannot be optimized due to the limitation of the semiconductor substrate used. Also, as defect density scales with area, the notion of integrating large scale functions (memory, switch fabrics) with small scale functions (rf devices) results in compounded yield impacts. System in Package (SiP) technology allows heterogeneous devices to be integrated into a small form factor. The integration technology includes embedded devices in the substrate and 3 dimensional chip-stacking approaches. By using a silicon based SiP, a copper/low K interconnect defined by lithographic processes on silicon offers very dense routing with high speed, low noise signal paths. The ICs used in the SiP can be designed to leverage the high density interconnect by optimizing both the core and the I/O of each device. Additionally, specialized devices can be designed specifically for the SiP architecture to take advantage of the high bandwidth and low latency features. Reducing chip-to-chip bus capacitance can dramatically decrease system power requirements and thermal dissipation. The lower bus power can be traded against higher bus frequency to improve performance at a fixed power level.},

   Abstract = {The memory bandwidth largely determines the performance of embedded systems. However, very often compilers ignore the actual behavior of the memory architecture, causing large performance loss. To better utilize the memory bandwidth, several researchers have introduced instruction scheduling/data assignment techniques. Because they only optimize the bandwidth inside each basic block, they often fail to use all available bandwidth. Loop fusion is an interesting alternative to more globally optimize the memory access schedule. By fusing loops we increase the number of independent memory operations inside each basic block. The compiler can then better exploit the available bandwidth and increase the system's performance. However, existing fusion techniques can only combine loops with a conformable header. To overcome this limitation we present loop morphing; we combine fusion with strip mining and loop splitting. We also introduce a technique to steer loop morphing such that we find a compact memory access schedule. Experimental results show that with our approach we can decrease the execution time up to 88%.},

   Abstract = {Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3DICs) have the potential to reduce interconnect lengths and improve digital system performance. However, heat removal is more difficult in 3DICs, and the higher temperatures increase delay and leakage power, potentially negating the performance improvement. Thermal vias can help to remove heat, but they create routing congestion, which also leads to longer interconnects. It is therefore very difficult to tell whether or not a particular system may benefit from 3D integration. In order to help understand this trade-off, physical design experiments were performed on a low-power and a high-performance design in an existing 3DIC technology. Each design was partitioned and routed with varying numbers of tiers and thermal-via densities. A thermal-analysis methodology is developed to predict the final performance. Results show that the lowest energy per operation and delay are achieved with 4 or 5 tiers. These results show a reduction in energy and delay of up to 27% and 20% compared to a traditional 2DIC approach. In addition, it is shown that thermal-vias offer no performance benefit for the low-power system and only marginal benefit for the high-performance system.},

   Abstract = {Interconnects are becoming an increasing problem from both performance and power consumption perspective in future technology nodes. The introduction of 3D chip architectures, with their intrinsic capability of reducing wire length, is one of the promising solutions to mitigate the interconnect problem. While interconnect power consumption reduces due to the adoption of 3D designs, the stacking of multiple active layers leads to higher power densities. Thus, high peak temperatures are of major concern in 3D designs. Consequently, we present a thermal-aware floorplanner for 3D architectures. In contrast to most prior work, our floorplanner considers the interconnect power consumption in exploring a thermal-aware floorplan. Our results show that excluding interconnect power can result in peak temperatures being underestimated by as much as 15/spl deg/C in 90nm technology. Finally, we demonstrate that our floorplanner is effective in lowering peak temperatures using a microprocessor design and four MCNC designs as benchmarks.},

   Abstract = {We are exploring a 3D processor-memory stack for use with the message passing interface (MPI). The communication among processors in huge servers wastes several thousands of cycles. Most of these wasted cycles do not come from the communication link among the processors across the system, but rather in handling the message packets. A processor that could handle this message packing and communication at a much faster rate could significantly increase this task's efficiency and thus increase the utilization of such supercomputers, currently a very low 1%. However, at such high clock rates, the memory wall would become a significant problem. Tackling this problem requires innovative technologies, such as 3D memories, which alleviate some problems with long on-chip interconnects. The importance of interconnection wires to circuit performance is on a chip. The need for shorter interconnection delays suggests shorter interconnection wires. Shorter interconnections are more likely in 3D architectures than in equivalent 2D systems. This article explores the advantages of 3D in a processor-memory stack system. We conducted simulations using simple tools like Dinero IV and the cache access and cycle time information (Cacti) to evaluate the performances of various memory architectures.},

   Pages = {300-311},
   Abstract = {We consider the efficiency of packet buffers used in packet switches built using network processors (NPs). Packet buffers are typically implemented using DRAM, which provides plentiful buffering at a reasonable cost. The problem we address is that a typical NP workloa may be unable to utilize the peak DRAM bandwidth. Since the bandwidth of the packet buffer is often the bottleneck in the performance of a shared-memory packet switch, inefficient use of available DRAM bandwidth further reduces the packet throughput. Specialized hardware-based schemes that alleviate the DRAM bandwidth problem in high-end routers may be less applicable to NP-based systems, in which cost is an important consideration. We propose cost-effective ways to enhance average-case DRAM bandwidth. In modern DRAMs, successive accesses falling within the same DRAM row are significantly faster than those falling across rows. If accesses to DRAM can be generated differently or reordered to take advantage of fast same-row accesses, peak DRAM bandwidth can be approached. The challenge is in exploiting this "row locality" despite the unpredictable nature of memory accesses in NPs. We propose a set of simple techniques to meet this challenge. These include locality-sensitive buffer allocation on packet input, reordering DRAM accesses to increase locality, and prefetching to reduce row miss penalty. We evaluate our techniques on cycle-accurate simulations of Intel's IXP 1200 network processor and find that they boost packet throughput on average by 42.7%, utilizing nearly the peak DRAM bandwidth, for a set of common NP applications processing a real trace.},

The simultaneous scaling of these two values leads to an overall reduction in the interconnect power by roughly a factor of the square root of the number of strata. For example, use of four strata leads to roughly a 50% reduction in total interconnect power. The reduction in interconnect lengths leads to smaller interconnect capacitances, offering the opportunity to lower transistor power as well.},

   Abstract = {Increasing clock frequencies and issue rates aggravates the memory latency problem, imposing higher memory bandwidth requirements. While caches can be multi-ported to provide high memory bandwidth, the increase in access latency with the increase in the number of ports limits their potential. The paper proposes a novel technique, called the 'temporal load cache architecture', to reduce load latencies and provide higher memory bandwidths. The key motivation for the technique is that temporal loads - dynamic instances of a static load instruction that access the same address as that accessed by the last dynamic instance of the same static load - constitute 48% of all dynamic loads on average for the SPEC2000 benchmarks. When a load is predicted to be temporal, the data predictd to be accessed by it are read early in the pipeline from a small temporal load cache that stores the temporal data. The proposed temporal load cache architecture has two main advantages. First, since instructions dependent on a temporal load are provided with their data early in the pipeline, they can be issued as soon as they resolve their remaining data dependences and resource conflicts. Second, since a large percentage of loads can be filtered by the temporal load cache, the main data cache can service other (nontemporal) loads better, providing higher memory bandwidth. The experimental results show that the proposed temporal load cache architecture improves performance by 8.3% on average for the SPEC2000 integer benchmarks.},

   Abstract = {Clusters of SMPs are becoming increasingly common. However, the shared memory design of SMPs and the consequential contention between system processors for access to main memory can limit their efficiency significantly. Moreover, the continuous improvement of modern cluster interconnection technologies leads to the network bandwidth being a significant fraction of the total memory bandwidth of the machine, thus the NIC of an SMP cluster node can also become a major consumer of shared memory bus bandwidth. In this paper we first provide experimental evidence that contention on the shared memory bus can have major impact on the total execution time of processes even when no processor sharing is involved, then present the design and implementation of an informed scheduling algorithm for multiprogrammed workloads, which tries to carefully select processes to be coscheduled so that bus saturation is avoided. The input data needed by our scheduler are acquired dynamically, at run-time, using architecture-specific performance monitoring counters and a modified version of the NIC firmware, with no changes to existing application binaries. Experimental comparison between our scheduler and the standard Linux 2.6 O(1) scheduler shows average system throughput improvements in the range of 5-25%.},

The MLBS technique uses a low temperature of 450/spl deg/C to transfer a single-crystal silicon layer over a processed wafer consisting of buried in-plane and out-of-plane interconnects obtained through a dual Damascene process. Devices can continue to be processed on this transferred layer. Electrical characteristics of MOS capacitors (D/sub it/=4.7/spl times/10/sup 10/ cm/sup -2/ eV/sup -1/) and 3-D integrated planar CMOS transistors (3-D CMOS), fabricated using MLBS, are consistent with integration requirements. Our analog analysis includes an investigation of thermal effects important to analog applications with continuous operation of transistors in forward active bias, as well as of the coupling isolation derived from use of a ground-plane. Use of high density local interconnectivity improves the thermal properties of 3-D CMOS over that of silicon-on-insulator, and use of a ground plane is shown to lead to an improvement of better than 8 dB in coupling isolation.},

This realization-led to the 3D system-in-package (SiP) approach, alternatively called 3D ICs or 3D stacked die/package. Designers can take SiP a step further by embedding both active and passive components, but passive-component embedding is bulky and requires thick-film discrete components. Thick-film component embedding distinguishes SiP from system on package (SoP), an emerging 3D system integration concept that involves embedding both active and passive components. SoP, however, incorporates ultrathin films at microscale to embed the passive components, and the package rather than the board is the system. SoP overcomes both the computing and integration limitations of SoC, SiP, multichip modules (MCMs), and traditional system packaging by having global wiring as well as RF, digital, and optical component integration in the package instead of on the chip. Moreover, 3D SoP addresses the wire delay problem by enabling the replacement of long, slow global interconnects with short, fast vertical routes.},

   Abstract = {Microprocessor performance has been improving at roughly 60% per year. Memory access times, however, have improved by less than 10% per year. The resulting gap between logic and memory performance has forced microprocessor designs toward complex and power-hungry architectures that support out-of-order and speculative execution. Moreover, processors have been designed with increasingly large cache hierarchies to hide main memory latency. This article examines how 3D IC technology can improve interactions between the processor and memory. Our work examines the performance of a single-core, single-threaded processor under representative work loads. We have shown that reducing memory latency by bringing main memory on chip gives us near-perfect performance. Three-dimensional IC technology can provide the much needed bandwidth without the cost, design complexity, and power issues associated with a large number of off-chip pins. The principal challenge remains the demonstration of a highly manufacturable 3D IC technology with high yield and low cost.},

At the compiler level, several techniques improve the memory bandwidth at the scope of a basic block, but often fail to exploit all. We propose a technique to optimize the memory bandwidth across the boundaries of a basic block. Our technique incrementally fuses loops to better use the available bandwidth. The resulting performance depends on how the data is assigned to the memories of the memory layer. At the same time, the assignment also strongly influences the energy cost. Therefore, we combine in our approach the fusion and assignment decisions. Designers can use our output to trade-off the energy cost with the system's performance.},

In multilayer structures, surface waves excited by planar discontinuities induce parasitic currents on adjoining interconnects, therefore, causing a parasitic coupling, which becomes a limiting factor as density increases and size reduces. This paper presents a study of those proximity effects on interconnect geometry for X- and W-bands. Various configurations of finite ground microstrip lines, finite ground coplanar (FGC) waveguides, and transitions have been analyzed for silicon and Duroid substrates. The results included in this paper illustrate the implications of parasitic coupling associated with interconnects printed in parallel or perpendicular configurations, lines located in close proximity to open-end discontinuities, vias etched near FGC lines, and finally vertical transitions through wafers. Theoretical and experimental results, in terms of reduced isolation, are provided, showing the advantages of the use of FGC lines over conventional microstrip lines since, in the cases investigated, they offer 8 dB higher isolation. Additionally, open-end effects are demonstrated to increase coupling by as much as 6 dB, while vertical transitions through wafers cause a parasitic coupling in the order of 3 dB. The results presented in this study can be employed in order to reduce parasitic interference between interconnects.},

We propose a new interconnect-centric multi-layer floorplanner named MF-SOP, which is based on a multiple objective stochastic simulated annealing method. The contribution of this work is to first formulate this new kind of floorplanning problem and then to develop an effective algorithm that handles various design constraints unique to SOP. The related experiments show that the area reduction of MF-SOP compared to its 2D counterpart is on the order of O(k) and wirelength reduction is 39% average for k-layer SOP, while satisfying design constraints.},

Evaluating such techniques, however, requires a thermal model that is practical for architectural studies. We describe HotSpot, an accurate yet fast model based on an equivalent circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances that correspond to microarchitecture blocks and essential aspects of the thermal package. Validation was performed using finite-element simulation. We also introduce several effective methods for dynamic thermal management (DTM): "temperature-tracking" frequency scaling, localized toggling, and migrating computation to spare hardware units. Modeling temperature at the microarchitecture level also shows that power metrics are poor predictors of temperature, and that sensor imprecision has a substantial impact on the performance of DTM.},

It is shown that under certain scenarios, 3D ICs can actually lead to better thermal performance than planar (2D) ICs. With the effect of vias, as efficient heat dissipation paths, taken into account, our model provides more realistic temperature rise estimation for 3D ICs. Furthermore, tradeoffs among power, performance, chip real estate and thermal impact for 3D ICs is evaluated.

Adaptive modifications of the planar transistors offer higher scalability and functionality, higher vertical interconnectivity in between device planes can reduce interconnect delays, higher programmability using configurable elements can provide efficient signal and energy flow, higher digital-analog isolation using ground-planes can provide cross-talk improvements for mixed-signal applications, and a power-aware design can allow control of temperature and power dissipation.},

   Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) stacked integrated circuits (ICs) can significantly improve circuit performance and offer the promise of integrating various technologies (memory, logic, RF, mixed-signal, optoelectronics) within a single block. Lack of 3D design tools and heat dissipation from vertically stacked multiple layers are the crucial problems in their development. To address these issues, CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) is developing methodologies and tools to analyze and assess coupled electrical and thermal performance of 3D ICs, including calculation of realistic full-chip thermal distributions and determining from them signal delay/distortion. Due to the stacking technology, extensive localized heating can occur. Analysis to minimize these hot spots using thermal vias is demonstrated. Our Python-script based framework allows to drive and control all the aspects of the 3D model building (directly from layouts), thermal simulations, and results extraction/post-processing. Hence, it is a good basis for coupling with Electronic Design Automation (EDA) systems. We present results of automated, fast, but detailed thermal simulations of 3D stacked integrated circuits. In addition, procedures for automatic extraction of reduced and compact thermal-resistance-based 3D models have been implemented. These techniques greatly reduce required computational time, and allow for very fast parametric modeling analysis of 3D IC design configurations and temperature extraction. From these thermal resistance models, equivalent SPICE netlists may be generated and used for independent or coupled thermal analysis.},

Our goal is to minimize the required memory bandwidth within the given cycle budget by adding ordering constraints to the flow graph. This allows the subsequent memory allocation and assignment tasks to come up with a cheaper memory architecture with less memories and memory ports. The importance and the effect of SBO is shown on realistic examples both in the video and asynchronous transfer-mode (ATM) domains. We show that it is important to take into account which data is being accessed in parallel, instead of only considering the number of simultaneous memory accesses. Our problem formulation leads to the optimization of a conflict (hyper) graph. For the target domain of ATM, only flat graphs without loops have to be treated. For this subproblem, a prototype tool has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of automating this important system design step},

   Abstract = {The advantages of 3D design can be exploited by reducing the memory access time. In this article, the authors use a simulator based on analytical models to build an optimal processor-memory configuration for two designs: a graphics processor and a microprocessor. One emerging alternative approach to relieving these interconnect constraints is the use of wafer-level 3D integration, which provides a high density of high-performance, low-parasitic vertical interconnects. A wafer-level 3D design is partitionable into multiple chips connected by short vertical vias. This arrangement reduces the length of many global interconnects without introducing any logic complexity. Wafer-level 3D integration also reduces the required number of repeaters, thereby improving the area efficiency and reducing the power consumed within the interconnect network. With micron-size interwafer vias, wafer-level 3D integration allows a large memory bandwidth with little wafer area consumption. We have developed a software program that allows a first-order comparison of cache designs in 2D and 3D IC technologies. We present a first-order estimate of the performance improvements achieved by 3D implementation of cache memory, with emphasis on large caches in deep-submicron technologies.},

The result of 3D die stacking is a significant reduction of interconnect both within a die and across dies in a system. For instance, blocks within a microprocessor can be placed vertically on multiple die to reduce block to block wire distance, latency, and power. Disparate Si technologies can also be combined in a 3D die stack, such as DRAM stacked on a CPU, resulting in lower power higher BW and lower latency interfaces, without concern for technology integration into a single process flow. 3D has the potential to change processor design constraints by providing substantial power and performance benefits. Despite the promising advantages of 3D, there is significant concern for thermal impact. In this research, we study the performance advantages and thermal challenges of two forms of die stacking: Stacking a large DRAM or SRAM cache on a microprocessor and dividing a traditional micro architecture between two die in a stack},

The resulting gap between logic and memory performance has forced microprocessor designs toward complex and power-hungry architectures that support out-of-order and speculative execution. Moreover, processors have been designed with increasingly large cache hierarchies to hide main memory latency. This article examines how 3D IC technology can improve interactions between the processor and memory. Our work examines the performance of a single-core, single-threaded processor under representative work loads. We have shown that reducing memory latency by bringing main memory on chip gives us near-perfect performance. Three-dimensional IC technology can provide the much needed bandwidth without the cost, design complexity, and power issues associated with a large number of off-chip pins. The principal challenge remains the demonstration of a highly manufacturable 3D IC technology with high yield and low cost.},

   Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits have emerged as promising candidates to overcome the interconnect bottlenecks of nanometer scale designs. While they offer several other advantages, it is expected that the benefits from this technology can potentially be off-set by thermal considerations which impact chip performance and reliability. The work presented in this paper is the first attempt to study the performance benefits of 3D technology under the influence of such thermal constraints. Using a processor-cache-memory system and carefully chosen applications encompassing different memory behaviors, the performance of 3D architecture is compared with a conventional planar (2D) design. It is found that the substantial increase in memory bus frequency and bus width contribute to a significant reduction in execution time with a 3D design. It is also found that increasing the clock frequency translates into larger gains in system performance with 3D designs than for planar 2D designs in memory intensive applications. The thermal profile of the vertically stacked chip is generated taking into account the highly temperature sensitive leakage power dissipation. The maximum allowed operating frequency imposed by temperature constraint is shown to be lower for 3D than for 2D designs. In spite of these constraints, it is shown that the 3D system registers large performance improvement for memory intensive applications.},

Multibanked organizations in combination with different approaches to allocate data to cache banks are explored. Some of the resulting cache architectures are shown to provide a good tradeoff between power and performance.},

abstract={Hardware techniques for improving the performance of caches are presented. Miss caching places a small, fully associative cache between a cache and its refill path. Misses in the cache that hit in the miss cache have only a 1-cycle miss penalty. Small miss caches of 2 to 5 entries are shown to be very effective in removing mapping conflict misses in first-level direct-mapped caches. Victim caching is an improvement to miss caching in that it loads the small fully associative cache with the victim of a miss and not the requested line. Small victim caches of 1 to 5 entries are even more effective at removing conflict misses than miss caching. Stream buffers prefetch cache lines starting at a cache miss address. The prefetched data are placed in the buffer and not in the cache. Stream buffers are useful in removing capacity and compulsory cache misses, as well as some instruction cache conflict misses. An extension to the basic stream buffer, called a multiway stream buffer, is introduced},

   Abstract = {The speed of VLSI chips is increasingly limited by signal delay in long interconnect lines. A simple analysis shows that major speed improvements are possible when using current-mode rather than conventional voltage-mode signal transporting techniques. The key to this approach is the use of low-resistance current-signal circuits to drastically reduce the impedance level and the voltage swings on long interconnect lines. As an example, a simple four-transistor current-sense amplifier for fast CMOS SRAMs is proposed. The circuit presents a virtual short circuit to the bit lines, thus reducing the sensing delay, which is rendered practically insensitive to the bit-line capacitance. In addition, the virtual short circuit ensures equal bit-line voltages, thus eliminating the need for bit-line equalization during a read access},

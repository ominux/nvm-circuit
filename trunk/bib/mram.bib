Various kinds of MTJ sizes and shapes have been evaluated and conclude that in ellipse like shape pattern aspect ratio more than 2 is enough for reproducing and reliable switching characteristics. As regards the reading characteristics, the combination of the optimized MTJ pattern and process makes 21.4 sigma separation between high and low resistance states. In further study of the relation between MTJ shapes and switching distribution, we found a "Saturn" shaped MTJ has best switching behavior. Also the toggle mode MRAM is evaluated and its effectiveness for high speed programming is confirmed.},

A macro-model of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is presented in this paper. This device is the most commonly used magnetic components in CMOS circuits. This model is based on spin-transfer torque (STT) writing approach. This very promising approach should constitute the second generation of MRAM switching technology; it features small switching current (~120uA) and high programming speed (&lt;1ns). The macro-model has been developed in Verilog-A language and implemented on Cadence Virtuoso platform with Spectre 5.0.32 simulator. Many experimental parameters are integrated in this model to improve the simulation accuracy. So, the model can efficiently be used to design hybrid magnetic CMOS circuits},

   Abstract = {3D die stacking is an exciting new technology that increases transistor density by vertically integrating two or more die with a dense, high-speed interface. The result of 3D die stacking is a significant reduction of interconnect both within a die and across dies in a system. For instance, blocks within a microprocessor can be placed vertically on multiple die to reduce block to block wire distance, latency, and power. Disparate Si technologies can also be combined in a 3D die stack, such as DRAM stacked on a CPU, resulting in lower power higher BW and lower latency interfaces, without concern for technology integration into a single process flow. 3D has the potential to change processor design constraints by providing substantial power and performance benefits. Despite the promising advantages of 3D, there is significant concern for thermal impact. In this research, we study the performance advantages and thermal challenges of two forms of die stacking: Stacking a large DRAM or SRAM cache on a microprocessor and dividing a traditional micro architecture between two die in a stack},

   Abstract = {Microprocessor performance has been improving at roughly 60% per year. Memory access times, however, have improved by less than 10% per year. The resulting gap between logic and memory performance has forced microprocessor designs toward complex and power-hungry architectures that support out-of-order and speculative execution. Moreover, processors have been designed with increasingly large cache hierarchies to hide main memory latency. This article examines how 3D IC technology can improve interactions between the processor and memory. Our work examines the performance of a single-core, single-threaded processor under representative work loads. We have shown that reducing memory latency by bringing main memory on chip gives us near-perfect performance. Three-dimensional IC technology can provide the much needed bandwidth without the cost, design complexity, and power issues associated with a large number of off-chip pins. The principal challenge remains the demonstration of a highly manufacturable 3D IC technology with high yield and low cost.},

   Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits have emerged as promising candidates to overcome the interconnect bottlenecks of nanometer scale designs. While they offer several other advantages, it is expected that the benefits from this technology can potentially be off-set by thermal considerations which impact chip performance and reliability. The work presented in this paper is the first attempt to study the performance benefits of 3D technology under the influence of such thermal constraints. Using a processor-cache-memory system and carefully chosen applications encompassing different memory behaviors, the performance of 3D architecture is compared with a conventional planar (2D) design. It is found that the substantial increase in memory bus frequency and bus width contribute to a significant reduction in execution time with a 3D design. It is also found that increasing the clock frequency translates into larger gains in system performance with 3D designs than for planar 2D designs in memory intensive applications. The thermal profile of the vertically stacked chip is generated taking into account the highly temperature sensitive leakage power dissipation. The maximum allowed operating frequency imposed by temperature constraint is shown to be lower for 3D than for 2D designs. In spite of these constraints, it is shown that the 3D system registers large performance improvement for memory intensive applications.},

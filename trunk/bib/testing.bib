   Abstract = {Performance of deep-submicrometer very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is being increasingly dominated by the interconnects due to decreasing wire pitch and increasing die size. Additionally, heterogeneous integration of different technologies in one single chip is becoming increasingly desirable, for which planar (two-dimensional) ICs may not be suitable. This paper analyzes the limitations of the existing interconnect technologies and design methodologies and presents a novel three-dimensional (3-D) chip design strategy that exploits the vertical dimension to alleviate the interconnect related problems and to facilitate heterogeneous integration of technologies to realize a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design. A comprehensive analytical treatment of these 3-D ICs has been presented and it has been shown that by simply dividing a planar chip into separate blocks, each occurring a separate physical level interconnected by short and vertical interlayer interconnects (VILICs), significant improvement in performance and reduction in wire-limited chip area can be achieved, without the aid of any other circuit or design innovations. A scheme to optimize the interconnect distribution among different interconnect tiers is presented and the effect of transferring the repeaters to upper Si layers has been quantified in this analysis for a two-layer 3-D chip. Furthermore, one of the major concerns in 3-D ICs arising due to power dissipation problems has been analyzed and an analytical model has been presented to estimate the temperatures of the different active layers. It is demonstrated that advancement in heat sinking technology will be necessary in order to extract maximum performance from these chips. Implications of 3-D device architecture on several design issues have also been discussed with special attention to SoC design strategies. Finally some of the promising technologies for manufacturing 3-D ICs have been outlined},

   Abstract = {The current technology in micro-and nano-electronics is insufficient to meet future demands for several applications. Most state-of-the-art solutions rely on so-called embedded technologies, which are both expensive and complex. One solution to the problem of integrating mixed technologies is the concept of 3D stacking. Our approach implements an epitaxial etch-stop layer for thickness control of the thinning process. Using this etch-stop layer, we can create a precise alignment of back-side vias to the landing pads in the first metal layer of the active CMOS, resulting in small via diameters and high connection densities between individual-layers of the 3D stack. Furthermore, we can use other materials, like GaAs (gallium arsenide), in combination with an epitaxial lift-off process. We use a copper-tin soldering process based on the solid-liquid interdiffusion (solid) process to create the electrical and mechanical connection between the single chip layers. Using this process, we created true multilayer stacks and tested them with respect to the static electrical properties of ohmic contacts and interchip vias. We directly incorporated these results in the design of test circuits that create tests for stuck-at failures of the interchip connections after stack assembly. This article presents a technology overview of how to achieve the goal in a 3D fabrication process. It also shows measurements for characterizing interconnects.},

Since power is an emerging problem, in this paper, we present a design technique for multiple scan chains in BIST (built-in self test) to reduce average power dissipation and test application time, while maintaining the fault coverage. First, we partition the scan chain into a set of smaller chains of similar lengths in such a way that the total number of scan transitions in the scan chain is minimized. Then, we use a novel scan re-ordering algorithm in each smaller chain to further reduce the transitions. Experiments on ISCAS'89 benchmarks show up to 46.2% (average 24.4%) power reduction using the proposed technique, compared to the scan partitions given in the RTL description. Unlike previous approaches, our solution is computationally efficient and test-set independent and thus, can be effectively applied to large BIST circuitry.},

   Abstract = {The authors propose a low-power testing methodology for the scan-based built-in self-test. This approach combines a low-power test pattern generator (TPG) with scan-chain reordering to achieve low-power testing without losing fault coverage. Three main issues are addressed. First, a smoother is included in the TPG to reduce the average power consumption. However, the fault coverage may be adversely affected by the smoother; hence, a cluster-based scan-chain reordering is employed to remedy this problem. If a very-large power reduction is necessary, the fault-coverage drop can become significant. This can be addressed by reseeding. The second topic of this paper is to give a detailed analysis on the optimal cluster size to minimize the scan-chain length. Finally, a fast and efficient algorithm is developed for scan-chain reorder in order to improve the fault coverage. The reordering algorithm is very efficient in terms of computation time, and the routing length of the reordered scan chain is comparable to or smaller than the result given by commercial tools. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a significant and consistent reduction in the average test power, and the fault coverage is similar to previous methods with the same test lengths},

   Abstract = {The paper presents a novel technique for power minimization during test application in sequential circuits using multiple scan chains. The technique is based on a new design for test architecture and a novel test application strategy which reduces spurious transitions in the circuit under test. To facilitate the reduction of spurious transitions, the proposed design for test architecture is based on classifying scan latches into compatible, incompatible and independent scan latches. Based on their classification, the scan latches are partitioned into multiple scan chains and a single extra test vector associated with eachscan chain is computed. A new test application strategy which applies the extra test vector to primary inputs while shifting out test responses for each scan chain, minimizes power dissipation by eliminating the spurious transitions which occur in the combinational part of the circuit. The newly introduced multiple scan chain-based technique does not introduce performance degradation and minimizes clock tree power dissipation with minimal impact on both test area and test data overhead. Unlike previous approaches which are test set dependent, and hence are not able to handle large circuits due to the complexity of the design space, the paper shows that with low test area and test data overhead substantial savings in power dissipation during test application are achieved in very low computational time for both small and large test sets. For example, in the case of the benchmark circuit s15850, it takes &lt;6009 in computational time and &lt;1 percent in test area and test data overhead to achieve over 80 percent savings in power dissipation},

   Abstract = {Scan testing is expensive in power consumption as each test vector requires a large number of shift operations with a high circuit activity. For a scan cell, the number of transitions caused by a test vector being scanned in depends not only on the transitions in the test vector but also on its position in the scan chain. Depending on the circuit structure, the transitions at some scan cells may cause more transitions at the internal circuit than those at other scan cells. Therefore, reducing scan transitions at those scan cells that cause more transitions in the internal circuit will result in greater reduction in switching activity. In the paper, the authors propose a scan cell ordering approach to reduce scan power consumption by arranging the scan cells which cause more internal circuit transitions to the positions with low transition weights in the scan chain. Two functions are developed to compute the transition weight of a scan cell and to measure the impact of transitions at a scan cell on switching activity in the internal circuit, respectively. Experiments performed on the ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits show that the average power consumption during scan testing can be reduced up to 17.35%. Moreover, because the proposed approach is independent of the order of test vectors, it can be utilised together with the existing test vector reordering techniques to further reduce test power.},

Unlike prior techniques where scan flip-flops can be reordered arbitrarily to form a new scan chain order, we restrict the distance by which a scan flip-flop can be moved to create the new scan chain order. The distance restriction makes it practical to make post-synthesis, local layout modifications to accommodate the new scan chain order. It also minimizes the routing overhead required for the new scan chain order. Given a post-synthesis scan chain order, we re-order flip-flops to minimize the number of undetectable faults due to test pattern dependency. Although the distance restriction limits the number of possible new scan chain orders, the fault coverage achieved by using our new local scan chain re-ordering method is comparable or even higher than prior methods. Moreover the scan order obtained with our method also improves the coverage of stuck-open faults. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve delay fault coverage by up to 21.8% for ISCAS 89 circuits.},

Unlike prior techniques where scan flip-flops can be reordered arbitrarily to form a new scan chain order, we restrict the distance by which a scan flip-flop can be moved to create the new scan chain order. The distance restriction makes it practical to make post-synthesis, local layout modifications to accommodate the new scan chain order. It also minimizes the routing overhead required for the new scan chain order. Given a post-synthesis scan chain order, we re-order flip-flops to minimize the number of undetectable faults due to test pattern dependency. Although the distance restriction limits the number of possible new scan chain orders, the fault coverage achieved by using our new local scan chain re-ordering method is comparable or even higher than prior methods. Moreover the scan order obtained with our method also improves the coverage of stuck-open faults. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve delay fault coverage by up to 21.8% for ISCAS 89 circuits.},

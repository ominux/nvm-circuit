\section{Introduction}

In modern computer architecture design, the storage of instruction and data
follows a hierarchical arrangement called \textbf{memory
hierarchy}, which takes advantage of the access locality and the performance-capacity trade-offs of
diverse memory technologies. The importance of the memory hierarchy
increases with the advances in microprocessor performance~\cite{ITRS07}.
Figure 1 illustrates a typical memory hierarchy. The closer the memory is placed to microprocessor,
the faster latency and higher bandwidth are required, with the penalty of the smaller capacity.
Different memory technologies, such as SRAM, DRAM, and magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) are
the common memory embodiments at the different levels in the memory hierarchy, respectively.
With the improvements in speed, density, and cost of Flash memory,
solid-state drives (SSD) have gained the momentum as the replacements
of the traditional magnetic HDD (Figure 1).

Besides increasing leakage power dissipation, technology scaling also significantly degrades
the reliability of SRAM and DRAM. In recent years, we have seen a lot of efforts have been made
to address the research and development of some
\textbf{emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies}, e.g.,
\textit{Phase-Change RAM (PCRAM)}, \textit{Magnetic RAM (MRAM)}, \textit{Resistive RAM (RRAM)}, and \textit{Memristor}.
By combing the speed of SRAM, the density of DRAM, and the
non-volatility of Flash memory, these emerging memory technologies demonstrated
a great potential to be the candidates of the future universal memories.

In order to enable the massive production and to accelerate the commercialization of the emerging memory technologies,
it is important for designers to understand their physical mechanisms, investigate new circuitries, and look for new
applications for better utilizing them to improve the performance/power/reliability of future computing systems.
To be more specific, we are trying to answer the questions as follows.

Here, we propose a three-year project. The main objective of the proposal is to study design techniques and system
applications for such emerging memory technologies ini future computer systems. The proposed program makes the
following major contributions.

new course modules on emerging non-volatile memories to complement and upgrade the core computer architecture courses,
and bring the awareness of emerging memory technologies into the circuit design and computer architecture community through
tutorials and workshops.}

Figure 1 illustrates the overview of the proposed project. The proposed work will initiate a novel research direction in high-performance system design and investigate the impact of emerging memory technologies on future computing systems. This work will support the deployment of modern microprocessor designs that use  emerging nonvolatile memory technologies. The proposed research will provide a complementary perspective to the existing computing system research.

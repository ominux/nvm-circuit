\section{Introduction}

In modern computer architecture design, the storage of instruction and data
follows a hierarchical arrangement called \textbf{memory
hierarchy}, which takes advantage of the access locality and the performance-capacity trade-offs of
diverse memory technologies. The importance of the memory hierarchy
increases with the advances in microprocessor performance~\cite{ITRS07}.
Figure 1 illustrates a typical memory hierarchy. The closer the memory is placed to microprocessor,
the faster latency and higher bandwidth are required, with the penalty of the smaller capacity.
Different memory technologies, such as SRAM, DRAM, and magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) are
the common memory embodiments at the different levels in the memory hierarchy, respectively.
With the improvements in speed, density, and cost of Flash memory,
solid-state drives (SSD) have gained the momentum as the replacements
of the traditional magnetic HDD (Figure 1).

Besides increasing leakage power dissipation, technology scaling also significantly degrades
the reliability of SRAM and DRAM. In recent years, we have seen a lot of efforts have been made
to address the research and development of some
\textbf{emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies}, e.g.,
\textit{Phase-Change RAM (PCRAM)} and \textit{Magnetic RAM (MRAM)}.
By combing the speed of SRAM, the density of DRAM, and the
non-volatility of Flash memory, these emerging memory technologies demonstrated
a great potential to be the candidates of the future universal memories.



As such emerging memory technologies are getting mature, it is important for architecture
designers to understand their pros and cons for better utilizing them to improve
the performance/power/reliability of future computing systems.
To be more specific, we are trying to answer the questions as follows.

 \vspace{5pt}
\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline
  $\bullet$ \textit{How to model such emerging NVM technologies?} \\
  $\bullet$ \textit{What will be the impacts of such NVMs on the future memory hierarchy?}\\
 $\bullet$ \textit{What are the research challenges to overcome for such a new memory hierarchy?} \\
 $\bullet$ \textit{What will be the novel applications/architectures with emerging NVM technologies?} \\
$\bullet$ \textit{How can graduate students be prepared for such future novel architectural innovations?}  \\
\hline
\end{tabular} \vspace{5pt}

    To answer these questions, we propose a three-year project. The main objective of the proposal is to study the design implication of such emerging memory technologies for future computer architecture systems. The proposed program makes the
following major contributions.

Figure 1 illustrates the overview of the proposed project. The proposed work will initiate a novel research direction in high-performance system design and investigate the impact of emerging memory technologies on future computing systems. This work will support the deployment of modern microprocessor designs that use  emerging nonvolatile memory technologies. The proposed research will provide a complementary perspective to the existing computing system research.

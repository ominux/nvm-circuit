\section{Research Overview}
To enable the massive production and commercialization of the emerging memory technologies, there are many critical technical issues to be solved. For example, how to introduce the novel devices into the existing design flow? How to minimize the process variation impacts? How to relieve the effect of the poor endurance and improve life time? In this project, we start with the modeling and analysis methodologies for emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs); Next, novel circuitry schemes will be proposed for each emerging NVMs based on their physical characteristics or issues; Finally, we explore novel applications that are enabled by the unique  features of emerging NVM technologies. Our proposed research takes a holistic design perspective with close collaboration between two PIs with complementary expertise, aiming at accelerating the adoption of emerging NVMs for future computer architecture design.

\section{Proposed Research}
To enable the massive production and commercialization of the emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs), there are many critical technical issues to be solved. For example, how to integrate these new devices into the existing design flow? How to reduce the impacts of process variations? How to improve poor endurance and prolong life time? How to further increase memory capacity and throughput? etc. To answer these questions, we will start with the device modeling and analysis methodologies for the emerging NVM technologies; On top of it, novel circuit techniques will be proposed for each emerging memory technology based on its unique device characteristic. Our proposed research takes a holistic design perspective with close collaboration between two PIs with complementary expertise, aiming at accelerating the adoption of emerging NVMs for future computer architecture design.
